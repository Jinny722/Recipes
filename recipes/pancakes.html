    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>Pancakes are a type of flatbread made from a batter that is typically composed of flour, eggs, milk, and butter. They are cooked on a hot griddle or frying pan and are often served with toppings such as syrup, fruit, or whipped cream. Pancakes are a popular breakfast food in many countries and can be enjoyed in
        a variety of ways.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, milk, egg, and melted butter.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; the batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or non-stick skillet over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, pour the batter onto the griddle or skillet. Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges are set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancake and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the griddle or skillet as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes hot, topped with your favorite syrup, fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
